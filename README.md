Some RPG tools written to practice Ruby

this is very much a WIP, but if somebody stumbles across this and wants anything added, let me know.

to run, navigate to the CoC directory in a terminal and run "ruby CoCcharGen.rb" to auto-generate a character.  You can save the character as a yaml file.

Things I will implement soon:
loading characters back into the program, for updating
a combat simulator
skills
other text dumps (such as names list, possessions, etc)

things I may some day implement:
a gui, but very little experience with this so that will probably be a while
convert a lot of the functionality to yaml so that it can be used with any character creator (the "birth" function for example)

Check issues for known broken areas.
