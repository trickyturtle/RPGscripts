You are indebted to them
*
They taught you something
*
They gave your life meaning
*
You wronged them and seek reconciliation
*
You shared an experience
*
You seek to prove yourself to them
*
You idolize them
*
You have a feeling of regret
*
You wish to prove yourself better than them
*
They have crossed you and you seek revenge
